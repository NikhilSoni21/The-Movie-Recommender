This project is based on content based recommending system.I have uses various techniques like similarity score, cosine similarity etc.
This application provides all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, recommended movies, etc.

### How it Works?
Similarity Score<br>
Similarity is a machine learning method that uses a nearest neighbor approach to identify the similarity of two or more objects to each other based on algorithmic distance functions<br>
Cosine Similarity<br>
Machine learning uses Cosine Similarity in applications such as data mining and information retrieval. For example, a database of documents can be processed such that each term is assigned a dimension and associated vector corresponding to the frequency of that term in the document.
